#REACT-BOILERPLATE-JOS
*Sorry for the awkward name, haha*


## What is this ?
This is the my react setup. so every time i want to start a new react project, i simply type 1 line command in my terminal and all setup is done.

## Why not used create-react-app ?
Sometimes there is something that i want to customize from create-react-app, and i feel like not find a good way to custom a create-react-app configuration.

## How to use
```
npx react-boilerplate-jos <your-app-name>
```

## Requirement
* Nodejs v12.20.1
* NPM 6.14.10
* git
